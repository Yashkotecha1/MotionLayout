In addition to describing transitions between layouts, MotionLayout lets you animate any layout properties, as well. Moreover, it inherently supports seekable transitions. This means that you can instantly show any point within the transition based on some condition, such as touch input. MotionLayout also supports keyframes, enabling fully customized transitions to suit your needs. MotionLayout is fully declarative, meaning that you can describe any transitions in XML, no matter how complex.MotionLayout bridges the gap between layout transitions and complex motion handling, offering a mix of features between the property animation framework, TransitionManager, and CoordinatorLayout.
